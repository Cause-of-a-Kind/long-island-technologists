In 2024, we developed the Long Island Technologists Meetup to bring together a community of innovators, developers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts. Our goal is to create a vibrant space where members can share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and forge lasting connections.

Coming into 2025 we're excited to expand our community and reach with more events, workshops, and networking opportunities. We're looking forward to meeting new members and continuing to grow together!
